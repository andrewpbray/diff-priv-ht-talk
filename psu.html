# While you're waiting

Please flip two coins. Note the results but keep them to yourself. Later on I will ask everyone with an answer of “yes” to raise their hand according to the following rules.

1. If the first coin came up H, respond truthfully to the question, “Have you ever done an illegal drug? (ecstasy, MDMA, magic mushrooms, LSD, cocaine, etc)
2. If the first coin came up T, respond truthfully to the question, “Did your second coin come up H?”

In addition to being ready with your response, think through why you would be comfortable saying it publicly or why it makes you uncomfortable.

# The Promise of Differential Privacy

The information learned about you by including your data in an analysis is essentially the same as would have been learned about you had you not contributed your data.

--

**Def.** Let `\(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\)` be a sample of size `\(n\)` that together comprise
the *database* with observed database `\(x\)`.  


--
**Def.** A *mechanism* `\(\mathcal{M}(\cdot)\)` is a randomized function of `\(x\)` with output `\(Z\)`.  


--
**Def.** `\(\xp\)` is a *neighboring database* to `\(\x\)` if there is only a single `\(i\)` s.t. `\(\x_i \ne \xp_i\)`.  


--
**Def.** `\(\M\)` satisfies `\(\epsilon\)`-*differential privacy* if, for all `\(\x, \xp\)` and all 
possible outputs `\(z\)`,

$$
\frac{\P(\M(\x) = z)}{\P(\M(\xp) = z)} \le e^\epsilon
$$

# Randomized response

**Goal:** Estimate `\(p = \P(X = \Y)\)`.

--

#### What distribution does `\(\M\)` induce in `\(Z\)`?

`\begin{align*}
\P(Z = Y) &amp;= \P(Z = \Y | X = \Y)\P(X = \Y) + \P(Z = \Y | X = \N)\P(X = \N) \\
&amp;= \frac{3}{4}p + \frac{1}{4}(1 - p) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}p + {1}{4}
\end{align*}`

--

#### What is the expected value of the sample proportion of `\(Z\)`'s?

Let `\(W = Z_1 + Z_2 + \ldots + Z_n\)`.

`\begin{align*}
\E(\frac{1}{n}W) &amp;= \frac{1}{n}n(\frac{1}{2}p + {1}{4})
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}p + {1}{4} = \hat{p}
\end{align*}`

A reasonable estimator: 

`$$\tilde{p} = 2\hat{p} - \frac{1}{2}$$`

---
# Randomized Response

### Theorem 1
`\(\M_R\)` is `\(\log(3)\)`-differentially private.

--

*Proof: Individual as curator*

Each `\(\x\)` is a singleton, so only 1 possible set of neighbors:

$$ \x = \Y; \quad \xp = \N$$
--

consider when `\(Z = \Y\)`

$$ \frac{\P(Z = \Y | X = \Y)}{\P(Z = \Y | X = N)} = \frac{3/4}{1/4} = 3,$$
--

and when `\(Z = \N\)`

$$ \frac{\P(Z = \N | X = \Y)}{\P(Z = \N | X = N)} = \frac{3/4}{1/4} = 3.$$

---
# The Laplace Mechanism

**Def.** Given any function `\(f\)` on a database, the Laplace mechanism is

`$$\M_L(\x, f, \epsilon) = f(\x) + L,$$`

where

`$$L \sim \text{Lap}(\mu = 0, b = \Delta f/\epsilon).$$`

--

### Properties of the Laplace

`\begin{align*}
p(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2b}\exp{-\frac{|x - \mu|}{b}} \\
\E(L) &amp;= \mu \\
\V(L) &amp;= 2b^2
\end{align*}`

--

**Def.** The `\(l_1\)`-*sensitivity* of a function `\(f\)` is

$$
\Delta f = \max_{\x, \xp} || f(\x) - f(\xp)||_1
$$

---
# The Laplace Mechanism

### Theorem 2

The Laplace mechanism preserves `\(\epsilon\)`-differential privacy.

--

*Proof*  


Denote as `\(Z\)` the r.v. created by `\(\M_L(\x, f, \epsilon)\)`, which has pdf `\(p(z) = \frac{1}{2b} e^{-\frac{|z - f(\x)|}{\Delta f / \epsilon}}\)`. We compare the probability densities corresponding to any neighboring databases at an arbitrary point `\(z\)`.

--

`\begin{align*}
\frac{p(Z = z | X = \x)}{p(Z = z | X = \xp)} &amp;= \frac{e^{-\frac{\epsilon |z - f(\x)|}{\Delta f}}}{e^{-\frac{\epsilon |z - f(\xp)|}{\Delta f}}} \\
&amp;= e^{\frac{\epsilon (|z - f(\x)| - |z - f(\xp)|)}{\Delta f}} \\
&amp;\le e^{\frac{\epsilon|f(\x) - f(\xp)|}{\Delta f}} \\
&amp;= e^{\frac{\epsilon||f(\x) - f(\xp)||_1}{\Delta f}} \\
&amp;\le e^{\epsilon}
\end{align*}`

where the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality and the last from the definition of sensitivity.

# `\(\M_R\)` vs. `\(\M_L\)`

--

### Generality

--

`\(\M_R\)` only works for Bernoulli data and output; `\(\M_L\)` works on any continuous output.

--

### Privacy

--

`\(\M_R\)` is fixed at `\(\epsilon = \log(3)\)`; `\(\M_L\)` works with any `\(\epsilon\)` (including `\(\log(3)\)`).

--

### Utility

--

Compare variance of estimators.

`$$\M_R: \frac{3}{4n} + \frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$`

`$$\M_L: \frac{2}{(\log(3)n)^2}$$`

---
# Key Points of Differential Privacy

1. Privacy requires a good definition.

--

2. Private mechanisms are easier to think about than private outputs.

--

3. Differential privacy adds noise to keep the amount learned about an individual
within provable bounds.

--

4. The focus has been on making private algorithms, not finding statistically
useful ones.

# Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing

### A plan for adaptation

1. Identify classical test

--

2. Bound `\(\Delta f\)`

--

3. Construct `\(\M\)` that satisfies `\(\epsilon\)`-differential privacy

--

4. Determine distribution of `\(Z\)` (the private test statistic) under `\(H_0\)`

--
### Tests of interest

- One-way ANOVA
- Wilcoxon Signed Rank
- Kruskal-Wallace
- Mann-Whitney U

---
# Wilcoxon Signed Rank

### 1. Identify classical test

*Goal*: Decide if paired data is consistent with a model where both sets are drawn from the same dist.

--

![wil](img/wilcoxon.png)

---
# Wilcoxon Signed Rank

### 2. Bound `\(\Delta f\)`

- How many different ways can two databases be neighboring?
- In what ways can the changed observation shift?
- Sensitivity is the maximum shift.

--

`$$\Delta f = 2n$$`

---
# Wilcoxon Signed Rank

### 3. Construct `\(\M\)` that satisfies `\(\epsilon\)`-differential privacy

---
# Wilcoxon Signed Rank

### 4. Determine distribution of `\(Z\)` under `\(H_0\)`

--

1. Randomly draw two iid sets of size `\(n\)` from a distribution
2. Compute `\(\widehat{\mathcal{W}\mathcal{P}}\)`
3. Repeat (1-2) many times
